Hi! I'm Arush, a senior Computer Science undergraduate studying at UCLA, also minoring in bioinformatics! I'm passionate about research in machine learning - specifically optimization, robustness and generalization. Over the past year, I have been involved in 2 projects in this space: the first is focused on making second-order optimization more computationally feasible with the use of a novel inversion algorithm (with [Prof. Louis Bouchard](https://www.chemistry.ucla.edu/directory/bouchard-louis-s/)), and the other on developing a novel contrastive learning algorithm debiasing gradients for better generalization to unseen domains (with [Prof. Elior Rahmani](https://eliorrahmani.com/home.html)).

Outside of school and work, I love to cook as well as play and watch a lot of soccer.
