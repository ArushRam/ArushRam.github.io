Education
---------
* B.S. in Computer Science, University of California, 2024 (Expected)
    * _Minor:_ Bioinformatics
    * _GPA:_ 3.93
    * _Honors:_ Dean's Honor List (Winter '21 - Fall '22), Shivakumar Endowed Scholarship in Computer Science, Upsilon Pi Epsilon, Tau Beta Pi

Work experience
---------------
* Student Researcher, Bouchard Lab UCLA _(May 2022 - Present)_
    * Implemented Gauss-Newton and Levenberg-Marquardt second-order optimization algorithms in TensorFlow to use in explainable AI models for landslide prediction.
    * Trained a 2-stage neural network aggregating multiple ResNets on the MSTAR radar image dataset with all inbuilt PyTorch optimizers and achieved accuracies exceeding 98%, matching literature.
    * Automated model tracking by writing scripts to parse hundreds of cluster job log files for model information, hyperparameters and performance measures and store results in csv files.
    * Supervisor: Prof. Louis Bouchard

* Flight Software Engineer, Unmanned Aerial Systems at UCLA _(April 2022 - Present)_
    * Led development on "Ground Station" dashboard displaying live telemetry and map position from a remote drone and ground vehicle for AUVSI SUAS inter-collegiate unmanned drone competition.
    * Presently researching and implementing motion planning algorithms for fixed-wing aircraft in next iteration of SUAS competition.

* Frontend Developer at ACM Teach LA _(October 2021 - August 2022)_
    * Produced several tutorial pages and ‘Terminal’ React component simulating Linux CLI for learning lab used to train ~40 ACM Cyber members and event participants in Linux fundamentals annually.
    * Designed and made Cartesian-coordinate exercises replicating Turtle movement for Teach LA’s Introduction to Python curriculum taught at a series of local schools.

* Student Researcher at Pioneer Academics _(April 2019 - August 2019)_
    * Studied materials theory pertaining to strength, fracture mechanics, thermodynamics and quantum mechanics.
    * Learnt molecular dynamics simulator packages LAMMPS and OVITO and ran atomistic simulations for various Aluminum alloys with Copper and Magnesium.
    * Analyzed simulation data using Python and materials theory to evaluate tensile strength-fracture toughness tradeoff of Aluminum.
    * Conveyed findings in a [research paper](https://arushram.github.io/PioneerAcademicsPaper.pdf) graded 97/100 by Prof. Frank Peiris of Kenyon College and shortlisted for publication in the Pioneer Research Journal.
