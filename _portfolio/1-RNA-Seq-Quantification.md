A Python implementation of the [IsoEM](https://almob.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1748-7188-6-9) and [RSEM](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-12-323) algorithms for quantification of RNA expression using alignments in BAM formats and transcripts in FASTA format. Future additions: [Kallisto](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3519)-based pseudoalignment from reads in FASTA format. See source code [here](https://github.com/ArushRam/RNASeq-Quantification).
