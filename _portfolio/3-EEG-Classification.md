Designed various CNN, RCNN and Fourier-Transform-based neural network architectures to classify motor EEG signals from a Brain Computer Interface Competition [dataset 2a](https://www.bbci.de/competition/iv/). These were implemented in PyTorch and achieved accuracies matching recent literature publications. View source code [here](https://github.com/ArushRam/147-EEG-Project).
